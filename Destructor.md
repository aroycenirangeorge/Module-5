# Exp.No:22  
## Destructor

---

### AIM  
To create a Python class `Student` with a destructor.

---

### ALGORITHM

1. Begin the program.  
2. Define the `student` class.  
3. Inside the `student` class, define the `__init__` method (constructor) and the `__del__` method (destructor).  
4. Create an object `s2` of the `student` class. When the object `s2` is created, the `__init__` method is called, and its print statements are executed.  
5. Use the `del` statement to delete the object `s2`. This triggers the `__del__` method (destructor), and the respective print statements are executed.  
6. Terminate the program.

# Name-Royce Niran George A

class Student:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

    def printDetail(self):
        print(f"My name is {self.name} and I am {self.age} years old.")

    def __del__(self):
        print(f"{self.name} student is deleted.")

s1 = Student("Vishvajit Rao", 22)
s1.printDetail()
del s1
